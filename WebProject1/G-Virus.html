        <li><i>Status Report of Bio-Weapon: Golgotha-virus</i></li>
        <li><em>Briefiing</em>: Causes mutations profusely, however,there is no transmittance. Which means the Golgotha-Virus' rate of infection is alomst non-existent.</li>
        <li><em>Transmittance</em>: Injection</li>
        <li><em>Symptoms</em>: resuscitation of dead cells;muations</li>
        <li><em>Incubation Period</em>:<i>10-15 seconds</i>
        <li><em>Effects</em>:Golgotha has extreme effects on the human body. The virus infects cells close by, turning them into so-called "G-Cells". These G-Cells then produce more of the virus, which will spread further across the body. As this gradual spread starts from the point of infection, the body may mutate asymmetrically. This is seen in Dr. Birkin, who infected himself in the right arm.</li>
